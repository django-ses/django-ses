A bird's eye view
=================
Django-SES is a drop-in mail backend for Django_. Instead of sending emails
through a traditional SMTP mail server, Django-SES routes email through
Amazon Web Services' excellent Simple Email Service (SES_).

Why SES instead of SMTP?
========================
Configuring, maintaining, and dealing with some complicated edge cases can be
time-consuming. Sending emails with Django-SES might be attractive to you if:

* You don't want to maintain mail servers.
* You are already deployed on EC2 (In-bound traffic to SES is free from EC2
  instances).
* You need to send a high volume of email.
* You don't want to have to worry about PTR records, Reverse DNS, email
  whitelist/blacklist services.
* Django-SES is a truely drop-in replacement for the default mail backend.
  Your code should require no changes.

Getting going
=============
Assuming you've got Django_ installed, you'll need Boto_ 2.1.0 or higher. Boto_
is a Python library that wraps the AWS API.

You can do the following to install boto 2.1.0 (we're using --upgrade here to
make sure you get 2.1.0)::

    pip install --upgrade boto

Install django-ses::

    pip install django-ses

Add the following to your settings.py::

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django_ses.SESBackend'

    # These are optional -- if they're set as environment variables they won't
    # need to be set here as well
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID'
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY'

    # Additionally, you can specify an optional region, like so:
    AWS_SES_REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'
    AWS_SES_REGION_ENDPOINT = 'email.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'

Now, when you use ``django.core.mail.send_mail``, Simple Email Service will
send the messages by default.

Since SES imposes a rate limit and will reject emails after the limit has been
reached, django-ses will attempt to conform to the rate limit by querying the
API for your current limit and then sending no more than that number of
messages in a two-second period (which is half of the rate limit, just to
be sure to stay clear of the limit). This is controlled by the following setting:

    AWS_SES_AUTO_THROTTLE = 0.5 # (default; safety factor applied to rate limit)

To turn off automatic throttling, set this to None.

Check out the ``example`` directory for more information.

SES Sending Stats 
=================

Django SES comes with two ways of viewing sending statistics.

The first one is a simple read-only report on your 24 hour sending quota,
verified email addresses and bi-weekly sending statistics.

If you wish to use the SES sending statistics reports, you must include
``django.contrib.admin``(for templates) and ``django_ses`` in your
INSTALLED_APPS and you must include ``django_ses.urls`` in your ``urls.py``.

Additionally, you can install ``pytz`` to localize the Amazon timestamp
(assumed UTC) to your locale. This will also make the date more readable,
using Django's default formatting.

If you need to keep send statistics around for longer than two weeks,
django-ses also comes with a model that lets you store these. To use this
feature you'll need to first run ``syncdb``:

    python manage.py syncdb

To collect the statistics, run the ``get_ses_statistics`` management command
(refer to next section for details). After running this command the statistics
will be viewable via ``/admin/django_ses/``.

Django SES Management Commands
==============================

To use these you must include ``django_ses`` in your INSTALLED_APPS.

Managing Verified Email Addresses
---------------------------------

Manage verified email addresses through the management command.

    python manage.py ses_email_address -l


Collecting Sending Statistics
-----------------------------

To collect and store SES sending statistics in the database, run:

    python manage.py get_ses_statistics

Sending statistics are aggregated daily (UTC time). Stats for the latest day
(when you run the command) may be inaccurate if run before end of day (UTC).
If you want to keep your statistics up to date, setup ``cron`` to run this
command a short time after midnight (UTC) daily.


Django Builtin-in Error Emails
==============================

If you'd like Django's `Builtin Email Error Reporting`_ to function properly
(actually send working emails), you'll have to explicitly set the
``SERVER_EMAIL`` setting to one of your SES-verified addresses. Otherwise, your
error emails will all fail and you'll be blissfully unaware of a problem.

*Note:* You will need to sign up for SES_ and verify any emails you're going
to use in the `from_email` argument to `django.core.mail.send_email()`. Boto_
has a `verify_email_address()` method: https://github.com/boto/boto/blob/master/boto/ses/connection.py

Contributing
============
If you'd like to fix a bug, add a feature, etc

    1. *Start by opening an issue.* Be explicit so that project collaborators
    can understand and reproduce the issue, or decide whether the feature
    falls within the project's goals. Code examples can be useful, too.
    2. *File a pull request.* You may write a prototype or suggested fix.
    3. *Check your code for errors, complaints.* Use check.py:
    https://github.com/jbalogh/check
    4. *Write and run tests.* Write your own test showing the issue has been
    resolved, or the feature works as intended.

Running Tests
=============
To run the tests::

    python manage.py test django_ses
